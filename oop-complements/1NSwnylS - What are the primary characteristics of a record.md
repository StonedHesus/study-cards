What are the `primary characteristics` of a `record`?
---
The `primary characteristics` of a `record` are the following:
  - `Immutable fields`, i.e. all `fields` of a `record` are `implicitly` `final`, meaning that they cannot be changed or altered once the `object` is `created`;
  - `Concise declaration`, i.e. you only define the `fields` (also known as `components`), and the rest (`constructor`, `accessors`, etcetera) are `automatically generated`.
