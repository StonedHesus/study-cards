Why do we need to employ the use of `boxing`?
---
`Boxing` is a necessary `process` in situations in which a `value type` needs to be treated as an `object` such as when passing `value types` to `methods` expecting `objects` or when `storing` them in `data structures` such as `collections` which only accept `reference types`.
