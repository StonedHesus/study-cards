What's the `strategy pattern`'s `intent`
---
`strategy pattern` is employed when we want to define `a family of algorithms`, and `encapsulate` each one, so as to make them `interchangeable`; in other words, the `strategy pattern` lets the `algorithm` vary `independently` from `clients` that use it, thus reducing `code coupling` and `enhancing` `extensibility`.
