What are the `disadvantages` of `dynamic typing`?
---
The `disadvantages` of `dynamic typing` are the following:
  - `errors` related to `types` might only show up at `runtime`, making `debugging harder`, and leaking `sensitive information` problematic;
  - less `performant` than `static typing` in `some cases` due to `runtime checks`
