What are the `restrictions` of the `diamond operator`?
---
The `restrictions` of the `diamond operator` are:
  -  The `diamond operator` can only be used when the `type arguments` can be `inferred` from the `context`;
  -  It can't be used in cases where the `type inference` is `ambiguous`, or not possible, such as when no information is available from the `lhs`.
