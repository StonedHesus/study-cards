How can one `violate` the `LSP`?
---
One can `violate` the `LSP` by altering the behaviour of an `inherited` `method` so that it interrupts the program in a way that wasn't specified in the `superclass's` definition, such as say throwing an exception; in other words, either all of the members of the hierarchy does this, or neither one does, aka socialism. =))
